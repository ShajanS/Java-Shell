User Stories carried over from the previous sprint:
a) I should be able to use !n to run the nth command run this session (2 hours)

User Stories we will be addressing in this sprint:
b) I should be able to recursively list the contents of one or more directories (5 hours)
c) I should be able to move an item into a different folder (3 hours)
d) I should be able to rename a file (3 hours)
e) I should be able to output the contents of multiple files to the console (2 hours)
f) I should be able to retrieve a file from the internet (5 hours)
g) I should be able to redirect the output of a command into a file. (3 hours)

Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1. Find what the nth command to be entered was
a-2. Process the command
b-1. For any directory whose contents are output by ls, if one of those items is a directory then output its contents as well
c-1. Get the object at the first specified path, if it exists
c-2. If the second specified path is a directory, move it into that directory
c-3. If not, that will be the object's new name
c-4. Remove the original object
d-1. Essentially the same as above
e-1. Make cat loop over the paths it is given and return all their contents. If a path does not exist, use an error message in its place instead
f-1. Check if the url is valid
f-2. Retrieve the contents of the file at the given url if so
f-3. Write these to the specified file
g-1. Check whether the parameters for a command contain redirection symbols
g-2. If so, perform the appropriate action with the command's output
g-3. If the redirection location does not exist, print an error message
h-1. Have commands make sure their parameters have the correct syntax
i-1. Unit tests for new commands and functionality
