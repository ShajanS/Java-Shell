What did I do last time?
	- Finished Cat, Man, Exit
	- reimplemented the functions to work with the new filesystem design
	- suppressed the warnings for exceptions
	- added JUnit4 for the files for testing 
	
What do I plan to do now?
	- finish unit testings for commands  
	- Format files to the required google doc format
	- tweak the java docs for the commands
	- fine tune commands and search for bugs
	
Am I blocked on anything?

	can not progress with unit testing until finished
