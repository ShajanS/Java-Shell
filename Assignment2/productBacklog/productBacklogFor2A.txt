Make A New Directory
As a user, when I execute the command mkdir, a new directory
should be made within the directory I am currently in. Alternatively
I should be able to make directories given a location starting
from the directory I am currently in. This will not take long to impliment as
we will be adding a directory object to target location defaulted at where
the command is entered.

Change The Current Directory
As a user, when I execute the command cd, the current directory I reside in
should be changed to the location given after cd. There should be some
shortcuts when this command is called, such as ".." and "-". This will be a
quick impliment as the current node will just change to target location.

Listing The Contents Of A Directory
As a user, when I execue the command ls, the contents of the directory I
am currently in should be displayed. The ls command should also be able to
display the contents of another directory given the file location, starting
from the directory I am currently in. This command wont take long to impliment
as it would just require a call to the getter of a diectory object.
